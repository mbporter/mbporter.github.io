<p>The Third Floor is an up and coming indie rock/folk/country jam band from Columbia, South Carolina. The band, comprised mostly of Juniors at the University of South Carolina, is working to refine their sound and further establish their presence as a live band in Columbia while also spending more time than ever before in the studio.

    The band released their debut single, “Not Worth the Time,” in March of 2022 and have released 3 singles since. It is unknown if an album will be in the works this year, but it’s highly likely.
    
    The band got their start in the music scene around town back in January of ‘22, when they played their first show at a local bar. The show went better than they had hoped for, drawing in a crowd of around 100 students from the University. Since then, they have been playing locally around Columbia at other bars, Greek life events, fundraisers, and tailgates. To stay up to date on what the band is currently up to, follow the Instagram page below! Enjoy the tunes</p>
<p> You can find them playing in bars around columbia and 5 points! Sometimes with no entryfee. To stay updated on where and when they are playing check their socials under the "Contact us" tab.</p>
