    <h2>American Psycho</h2>
    <h4>
By Bret Easton Ellis
    </h4>
    <p>Patrick Bateman is twenty-six and he works on Wall Street, he is handsome, sophisticated, charming and intelligent. He is also a psychopath. Taking us to head-on collision with America's greatest dream—and its worst nightmare—American Psycho is bleak, bitter, black comedy about a world we all recognise but do not wish to confront.</p>

        <h2>American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer</h2>
        <h4>
    By Kai Bird

        </h4>
        <p>American Prometheus is the first full-scale biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, "father of the atomic bomb," the brilliant, charismatic physicist who led the effort to capture the awesome fire of the sun for his country in time of war. Immediately after Hiroshima, he became the most famous scientist of his generation-one of the iconic figures of the twentieth century, the embodiment of modern man confronting the consequences of scientific progress.
